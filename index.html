                    Our business began in 1976 when our founder, Charles D. Carruth, first started operations Charles County, MD.
                    With years of experience already in the industry the business hit the ground running and has kept going ever since.
                    Today the whole Carruth family is a part of the business. While Mr. Carruth still is actively involved our business
                    is also managed by his son Charles D. Carruth II. Additionally his daughter in-law and three grandsons, Brenden, Bradley
                    and Thomas play an active role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We attribute our success largely to our business philosophy which focuses on being a trusted ready mix supplier
                    to local contractors and homeowners. We strive to provide a dependable product alongside the best in customer service.
                    We never leave a job incomplete and always strive to arrive on time every time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started small in Charles County, MD but have since been able to extend our services to the surrounding areas in Calvert
                    and Saint Mary's Counties. We are also able to service parts of southern Prince George's County and parts of northern
                    Virginia such as King George, VA.
