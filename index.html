                        Carruth & Son Concrete was founded by Charles and Mary Carruth in 1976 with the ambition of becoming one of the communities
                        most trusted sources for ready mix concrete. To this day the business has remained in the family and is currently jointly
                        managed by the founders themselves and their son Charles D. Carruth II.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our business philosophy is where we as a company attribute our success in the industry. We focus on being a trusted ready mix supplier
                        to local contractors and homeowners, provide a dependable product designed to last and work to provide the best in customer service.
                        We aim to be punctual, never leave a job unfinished and always do our best to work with our customers when the unforseen occurs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We began our operation in Charles County, MD but have since been able to extend our services to the surrounding communities that make
                        up Southern Maryland. Currently we are also able to service parts of southern Prince George's County as well as parts of northern
                        Virginia such as King George, VA.
